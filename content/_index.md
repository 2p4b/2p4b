## Hello there stranger..

Need a some light? here you go ðŸ’¡

I'm 2p4b and i like reducing data, My first paid work experience was setting up a wireless hotspot access point with Mikrotik RouterOS for a WISP in 2013 thats over a decade now. 

My tools of choice are C, C++, Elixir, SQL, Python, JavaScript, and TypeScript, including React and related libraries. 

I love playing with numbers finding patterns in my free time with a recent fascination for event-driven systems, I excel in creating scalable, efficient solutions.

### Core Competencies
- **Backend Mastery:** Use of Elixir for building concurrent, fault-tolerant systems.
- **Systems Programming:** Skilled in C and C++ for performance-critical applications, and YES i know Rust, Zig and others exists.
- **Database Administration:** Experienced in designing and implementing SQL databases with efficient queries in PostgreSQL and MySQL or a complete rewrite of a datastore.
- **Data Science & ML:** Experienced in Python for data analysis and machine learning.
- **Data Visualization:** Data visualization for data analysis and spreadsheets.(Google Sheets)
- **Frontend Development:** Mastered JavaScript and TypeScript, specializing in React and related libraries for UI development.
- **Security:** Please understand this. Your current systems can be exploited by me! there is always an edge case left hanging and its only a matter of time until its found. Don't believe me? Hire me lets test it! before someone else does.
- **Network Administration:** Use of linux to build and manage routes, tunnels, VPN (wiregaurd best), vlans, and openvswitch
- **Linux Container:** Regular use of namespaces and cgroup to isolate processes and resources, and for container orchestration.
