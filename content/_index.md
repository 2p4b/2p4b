## Hello there stranger..

Need some light? here you go ðŸ’¡

I'm 2p4b. My journey in technology began over a decade ago when I called up to set up a wireless hotspot access point using Mikrotik RouterOS for a WISP Provider in 2013. 
Today, I leverage a broad toolkit including C, C++, Elixir, SQL, Python, JavaScript, and TypeScript to craft scalable and efficient software solutions.

I am passionate about discovering patterns in large datasets and have a keen interest in event-driven systems. 

My philosophy is simple: every computer science problem at its core is a data problem.


### Core Competencies
- **Backend Mastery:** Use of Elixir for building concurrent, fault-tolerant systems.
- **Systems Programming:** Skilled in C/C++ for performance-critical applications, and Yes i know of Rust, Zig and the others.
- **Database Administration:** Seasoned Experience in designing and implementing SQL databases with efficient queries in PostgreSQL and MySQL or a complete rewrite of a datastore.
- **Data Science & ML:** Experienced in Python for data analysis and machine learning.
- **Data Visualization:** Data visualization for data analysis and spreadsheets.(Google Sheets)
- **Frontend Development:** Mastered JavaScript and TypeScript, specializing in React and related libraries for UI development.
- **Network Administration:** Use of linux to build and manage routes, tunnels, VPN (wiregaurd best), vlans, and openvswitch
- **Linux Container:** Regular use of namespaces and cgroup to isolate processes and resources, and for container orchestration.
- **Tech Security:** Please understand this, 100% Tech Security Coverage today is a difficult feat to archive, as there are always edge cases left hanging and its only a matter of time before its found. Don't believe me? Reach out to me lets test(fuzz) your system and see if it holds up! before someone else does.


### My Current Projects
1. [Signal](https://github.com/2p4b/signal): Elixir CQRS library.
2. [Blueprint](https://github.com/2p4b/blueprint): Elixir schema and validation library.
3. [Kanban Project Management](https://github.com/2p4b/octal-clients): Chat and Kanban Project Management webapp(frontend webapp only) ReactJS, Redux, Redux-Saga

### Older Projects
- [Multilayer perceptron](https://github.com/2p4b/backprop): A curious fun implementation of an MLP in Jupyter Notebook.
- [Asyncpaths](https://github.com/2p4b/AsyncPaths)(outdated): PhaserJS pathfinding plugin.
- [etc...](https://github.com/2p4b?tab=repositories)


### Other Works
Go through my github [repositories](@https://github.com/2p4b).

### Notable Achievements
- I'm still Alive
- I'm a Proud Uncle of 4
- Successfully led the development of a CQRS system in golang.

### Hobbies
- Contribute to open-source projects.
- Snooping on my network traffic with scapy, looking to see who is talking to whom and whats being sents
- Playing with SDR, and always trying to listern in ðŸ˜‰

Do you find any of these fun too and want chat about your curious journey? [ðŸ‘‰ 2p4b@proton.me](@mailto:2p4b@proton.me).
