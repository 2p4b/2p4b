# Curiosity's Call
In the realm of curiosity, we embark,
Exploring the world, leaving no stone in the dark.
Numbers, our companions, guide us through,
Unveiling patterns, revealing what's true.

I seek to understand,
The language of numbers, a symphony so grand.
From Fibonacci's sequence to Pi's endless stream,
Patterns emerge, like a mesmerizing dream.

Curiosity drives me to unravel the unknown, and 
after many failures, sometimes I'm able
to decipher the secrets that numbers have shown.
In equations and formulas, I find delight,
As patterns emerge, shining ever so bright.

From fractals to algorithms, our minds take flight,
Discovering beauty in patterns, both day and night.
Curiosity fuels our quest to break and create,
As numbers and patterns continue to astound.

So let us embrace curiosity's call,
Dive deep into numbers, explore them all.
For in the realm of patterns, we shall find,
A world of wonder, forever intertwined.
